Spout2 SDK examples

The CINDER and OpenFrameWorks examples depend on these host systems being installed and experience with them.

The examples also require all the files from the Spout SDK. These are in the SPOUTSDK\SpoutSDK folder of the installation. Get the latest at : https://github.com/leadedge/Spout2

The receiver examples depend on SpoutPanel.exe to select senders. It's path is detected from the registry after installation. Otherwise it must be copied to the folder for the binary.

Prebuilt binaries are no longer included.
