SpoutDXmode 

is a utility program to change the operation mode for Spout applications.

Options are :

o DirectX 9 - switch between DirectX 9 and DirectX 11 functions
o Memory    - change to CPU memory for data sharing instead of DirectX

All Spout applications built with the Spout 2.005 SDK will then switch to the selected mode.
This will not have any effect for applications built with the 2.004 SDK.

Additionally, for laptop computers with dual graphics and NVIDIA Optimus power
saving technology, the mode of operation can be changed to enable the high performance
NVIDIA graphics globally for all applications. This over-rides the NVIDIA control panel
settings and can be useful where there is difficulty in adjusting these settings

This will not have any effect if the computer does not have Optimus graphics or is not NVIDIA.
